What is the cost of a street? Specifically, what is the cost of public realm amenities those of us that live in dense urban areas take for granted? Toronto’s complex St Clair Avenue West and Vaughan Road intersection has been analyzed by The Grid in 2013 to set a price on how much it costs to put it all together. 

You would be surprised at the costs of some of these urban pieces that we take for granted: $2,717 for a trashcan and a whopping $155,000 for a streetcar (or bus) shelter. The exciting topic of infrastructure costs has been on my mind lately for work and school-related reasons. These significant numbers are something to keep in mind when you get the urge to complain about taxes ☺ 

Note: All pricing is in 2013 Canadian dollars.
