Welcome to my personal website and blog. I am currently situated in Vancouver, BC and I write about transportation planning and engineering, sharing my ideas as well as reposting others. Before entering this field, I was excited by reading and experiencing transportation-related topics. Since this is now my “work,” I have unfortunately stopped approaching the subject with the same enthusiasm. The goal of this blog is to get re-inspired and excited about my favourite transportation topics: sustainable transport, data, economics and technology. Enjoy the visit, I hope to appeal to the transportation nerd in you. Views are my own.
