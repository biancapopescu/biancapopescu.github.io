Traffic is getting worse, or at least it is in San Francisco. 

I’m a sucker for cool looking infographics, and this beautiful one in WIRED magazine caught my eye. I have heard some horror stories about San Francisco’s traffic, and this image is showing yes, delays in the AM and PM peak are in fact getting worse since 2010. Some motivation for improved public transportation and self-driving cars, maybe? 

Note: Data comes from traffic research shop Inrix. Please excuse the poor quality as I used this old school tool called a "scanner."
