Peaceful photos of Vancouver’s downtown core on Christmas morning give us an idea of how the city might look without dense traffic. 

During the holidays, as a pedestrian in my Kitsilano neighbourhood, I personally enjoyed the quiet while safely walking without worrying about rushed traffic zooming through residential streets. I will miss this peace as we get back into the swing of January and some Vancouverites choose to stress from one destination to another in private vehicles.
