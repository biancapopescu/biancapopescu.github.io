The National Geographic published this infographic comparing average hours spent in traffic per driver in North American and European cities (2012). Delays were estimated by comparing real-time traffic observations with data for a typical commute.

Everyone knows traffic is frustrating, but how much time of your life do you lose to it? In many of these cities, the annual delays per driver totalled more than the 40-hour work week! Factors causing traffic delay fluctuations include accidents, fuel costs, the quality of transit and the state of the economy.
